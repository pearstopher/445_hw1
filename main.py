# Christopher Juncker
# This is a sample Python script.

# 11. This is a short coding problem. You will use a perceptron with 785 inputs (including bias input)
# and 10 outputs to learn to classify the handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset
# (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). See the class slides for details of the perceptron architecture
# and perceptron learning algorithm.
